# youtube-clone
Built with React, this application uses the Axios to fetch data from the YouTube API and allows users to search and play videos from YouTube.

## Process
This branch is built using hooks instead of classes for both the App and the SearchBar components. A custom hook was also created separately so the component that fetches videos using the search  term can be reused if an analytics component is ever built.

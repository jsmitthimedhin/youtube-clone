# youtube-component
Built with React, this application uses the Axios to fetch data from the YouTube API and allows users to search and play videos from YouTube. The tutorial for this application is by Stephen Grider's "Modern React and Redux" class on Udemy.

###### Upcoming - A branch using hooks instead of class-based React for good practice.
